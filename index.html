    <h2>The World Wide Web and HTML</h2>
      <b> WWW (World Wide Web)</b>
  <p>The World Wide Web is a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a markup language called HTML  that supports links to other documents, <br> as well as graphics, audio, and video files.</p>
  
  <p>The web was invented in the early 1990s, and has something on the order of 30 billion pages.</p>
  
  <p>A web page is a text document written in HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>

     <p>
       <b><em>HTML</em></b> is an abbreviation for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the basic format for language that is used to construct the World Wide Web.<br> (Think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure.)</p>
     <p>
       <b><em>Hypertext</em></b> means "text with links in it". Anytime you click on a word that brings you to a new page, you’ve clicked on hypertext.
     </p>
     <p>
       <b><em>Markup Language</em></b> is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page:<br> It can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more.
       </p>
       <b>Tags and Attributes</b>
     <p>
       <b><em>Tags</em></b> are elements of the HTML document used to specify how the document should be displayed by the browser. In HTML, each tag has its own specific meaning. <br> Tags are surrounded by angle brackets, and normally come in pairs like < b >   < /b >. <br> The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second is the end tag. The text between the start and end tags is the element  content.
     </p>
     <p>
       <b><em>Attributes</em></b> are associated with each tag to further define the tags. An Example of an attribute would be "href".
